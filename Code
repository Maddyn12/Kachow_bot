Boy, you shoulda heard me on giddy-up, oom papa mow mow. Now, I'm not one to brag, but people come purty far to see me get low on the mow-mow.", "Lightning McQueen: [Then a bubble of tar comes out from one of Bessie's pipes, pops, and a little slob of tar lands on McQueen's right bolt sticker.] [McQueen gasps] Aw, man, that's just great!", "Tow Mater: Hey, what's wrong?", "Lightning McQueen: My lucky sticker's all dirty.", "Tow Mater:That ain't nothing', I'll clean it for you!", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah That would be necessary.  Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red! I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off.  What, where's he going?", "Mater: Oh, he's just a little bit shy, and he hates ya for killin' his flowers.", "Lightning McQueen: I shouldn't have to put up with this! I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics!", "Mater: You hurt your what?", "Lightning McQueen: I'm a very famous race car!", "Luigi: You are a famous race car? A real race car?", "Lightning McQueen: Yes, I'm a real race car. What do you think? Look at me.", "Luigi: I have followed racing my entire life of my whole life!", "Lightning McQueen: Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen.", "Luigi: Lightening McQueen!", "Lightning McQueen: YES! YES!", "Luigi: I must scream it to the world! My excitement from the top of someplace very high! Do you know many Ferraris?", "Lightning McQueen: No, no, no. They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup! What?", "Luigi: Luigi follow only the Ferraris.", "Flo: Is that what I think it is?", "Sally Carrera: Customers. Customers! Customers, everyone! Customers! Okay!", "Lizzie: Customers?", "Sally Carrera: All right, everybody calm down for a long time. Just remember what we rehearsed. Make sure your Open, please come in signs are out. And you all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go!", "Minny: Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.", "Van: Minny, I know exactly where we are.", "Minny: Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.", "Van: Honey, please.", "Sally Carrera: Hello. Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley. Legendary for it's quality service and friendly hospitality. How can we help you?", "Van: We don't need anything, thank you very much. [drives past Sally, to Van]", "Minny: Whoa, honey ask her direction to the Interstate.", "Van: There's no need to ask for directions. Minny, I know exactly where we're going.", "Minny: [to Sally] He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee. You know, we were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we...", "Van: [chuckles] Okay, okay. Really. We're just peachy, okay?", "Fillmore: What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel.", "Van: [chuckles] No, it doesn't agree with my tank.", "Minny: We're just trying to find the Interstate.", "Sarge: Good to see you, Soldier! Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for all your government surplus needs.",  "Minny: Oh, honey, surplus!", "Van: I think we have too much surplus.", "Sally Carrera: I do have a map over the Cozy Cone Motel. And if you do stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast.", "Minny: Honey, she's got a map.", "Van: I don't need a map! I have the GPS. Never need a map again, thank you.", "Flo: How 'bout somethin' to drink? Stop at Flo's V8 Café. Finest fuel on Route 66.", "Van: No, we just top off.", " Luigi: [juggles tires while Luigi is talking, and ends with most of them in a pile with one standing up on top] And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.", "Minny: We're just trying to find the Interstate.", "Ramone: But you do need a paint job man. Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want! You know, like a flame job.", "Minny: No, thanks...", "Ramone: Maybe ghost flames! You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style, huh? [lifts his rear end up in front in Van and Minny gasping]", "Minny: Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.", "Van: [laughs] Okay, no.  We're gonna be going now, okay?", "Lizzie: [laughing] A little somethin' to remember us by, okay?", " Van: [laughs] Okay! [drives away along with Minny]", "Sally Carrera: Come back soon, okay? I mean, you know where we are! [giggles] Tell your friends!", "Van:  Okay! Yes. You bet.", "Minny: Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.", "Lightning McQueen: Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey,hey! I know how to get to the Interstate!", "Minny: Oh, do ya?", "Van: Minny, no.", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah, yeah,yeah. No, not really. But listen. I'm Lightning McQueen, the famous race car. I'm being held heren against my will. [Van then grins as Minny smiles at McQueen.] And I need you to call my team, so they can rescue me, and get me to California in time for me to win The Piston Cup. Do you understand?", "Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no, no. No, It's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!! I'm in hillbilly hell!! My IQ's dropping by the second!! I'M BECOMING ONE OF THEM!!!", "Sally Carrera: [Van and Minny disappear as McQueen yells, and them is echoed. Sally sighs, and then talks to the other residents] Okay, don't worry. They know where we are now. They're gonna tell their friends. You'll see.", "Radio: And we'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...", "Sally Carrera: That's good. [as the other residents drive away]", "Radio: [through the radio] ...after a Piston Cup update. Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Meanwhile, Chick Hicks arrived in California and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.", "Chick: [through the radio] Yeah, well it's just nice to get out here before the other competitors. You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.", "Chick: Yeah! Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.", "Lightning McQueen: [Then McQueen's daydream ends as the screen shows the present day. McQueen gasps] Oh! Mater, let me get this straight. I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?", "Tow Mater: That's what they're done they said.", "Lightning McQueen: Okay, outta my way. I got a road to finished.", "Tow Mater: [Then the camera shows inside Doc Hudson's office as Mater comes in] He's done!", "Doc Hudson: Done?", "Tow Mater: [nobs his face] Ahmhm.", "Doc Hudson: It's only been an hour.", "Lightning McQueen: I'm done. Look, I'm finished. Just say thank you, and I'll be on my way. That's all I gotta say.", "Tow Mater:  WHOO HOO! I'm the first one on the new road! OH! [drives onto the road, and vibrates as he moves over the bumpy tar, and several objects fall off him] It rides purty smooth. ", "Sally Carrera: It looks awful!", "Lightning McQueen: Well, it matches the rest of the town.", "Sally Carrera: Oh!", "Sally Carrera: Red.", "Sally Carrera: Who do you think you are?", "Lightning McQueen: Look! Doc said when I finish, I could go! That was the deal!", "Doc Hudson: [driving up] The deal was you fix the road, not making it worse. Now, scrape it off! Start over again.", "Lightning McQueen: Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a race car.", "Doc Hudson: Ho,ho,ho! Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.", "Sally Carrera: What?", "Lightning McQueen: [chuckles] Me and you. Is that a joke?", "Doc Hudson: If you win, you go and I fix the road. If I win, you do the road my way.", "Sheriff: Doc, what're you doin'?", "Lightning McQueen: [laughs] I don't mean to be rude here Doc, but you probably go zero to sixty in like what? Three-point-five years?", "Doc Hudson: Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.", "Lightning McQueen: You know what old timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.", "Sheriff: Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race. You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back. There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin', no bittin', no road rage, no maimin', no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin' and no lollygaggin'.", "Lightning McQueen: [whispering to Mater] Speed. I'm speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.", "Luigi: [laughing] My friend Guido, he dream to give a real race car a pit stop!", "Guido: [turns up] Pit stop!", "Lightning McQueen: [groans, chuckles] The race is only one lap, guys. Uno lappo! [Luigi's smile then turns to a frown, while Guido is still shaking happily.] Don't need any help. I work solo mio.", "Luigi: Fine. Race your way. [drives away to join the others, Guido is still standing there shaking happily.]", "Lightning McQueen: No pit stoppo. Comprendo?", "Guido: Okay. [drives away to join the others]", " Sheriff: Gentlemen. Start your engines!", "Ramone: ¡Hijole! Check that out!", "Fillmore: Whoa.", "Flo: Emm, emm.", "Sally Carrera: Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.", "Sheriff: Luigi? [then he joins the others as Luigi drives onto the road with his Ferrari flag to start the race.]", "Luigi: [chuckling] On your mark, get set. Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to...  I can't believe it...Go!!", "Doc Hudson: Yee ha! Ha ha ha!", "Sally Carrera: Yeah.", "Luigi: Huh? Doc, the flag means go. Remember the fl... Here we go. Go.", "Ramone: Um... Doc, what are you doing, man?", "Doc Hudson: Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start. Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater. Might need a little help.", "Tow Mater: Um, okay. [drives alongside Doc]", "Doc Hudson: You got your tow cable?", "Tow Mater: [showing his tow cable] Well, yeah. I always got my tow cable. Why?", "Doc Hudson: Oh, just in case.", "Lightning McQueen: [screams] AH, OW, OW, OW, OW, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!!", "Ramone: Oh, man! Ow!", "Fillmore: Whoa. Bad trip, man.", "Doc Hudson: HEY!!!!!!!!!! Was that floating like a Cadillac, or was that stinging like a Beemer? I'm confused.", "Tow Mater: [chuckles]", "Doc Hudson: You drive like you fix roads. [McQueen's frowns angrily] Lousy! [to Mater] Have fun fishing, Mater.", "Lightning McQueen: [Mater swings his tow cable, and throws his hook towards McQueen, which it grabs onto his rear end. McQueen gasps and Mater then pulls McQueen out of the cactus.]", "Tow Mater: I'm startin' to think he knowed he was gonna crash!", "Lightning McQueen: [as he gets pulled up the side of the valley] Thank you, Mater. Thank you.", "Lightning McQueen: I can make a little turn on dirt. You think? [grunts as he scrapes another bit of tar] No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here!", "Ramone: Hey, ése! You need a new paint job, man!", "Lightning McQueen: No, thank you.", "Fillmore: How 'bout some organic fuel?", "Sarge: That freak juice?", "Lightning McQueen: Pass.", "Flo: Whoo! Watchin' him workin' is makin' me thirsty. [to Mater] Anybody else want somethin' to drink?", "Tow Mater: Nah, not me, Flo. I'm on one of 'em there special diets.  I'm a precisional instrument of speed and air-matics.", "Lightning McQueen: You race like you fix roads. I'll show him.  I will show him! Aw, great!! I hate it!! Hate, hate, hate, hate it!!!", "Doc Hudson: [chuckles] Music. Sweet music. [drives into his building]", "Sally Carrera: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.", "Lightning McQueen: Radiator Springs, a happy place!!", "Bessie: [clucking] [Sally drives into her building at the Cozy Cone Motel as the rest of all go into their tents to try to get some sleep despite fart noises and McQueen's very loud complaining]", "Lightning McQueen: [Then another slop of tar lands on McQueen.] Whoa, okay, Bessie you think that funny? Great! I'M TALKIN' TO BESSIE NOW! I'M TALKIN' TO BESSIE!!!", "Tow Mater: [Then the screen shows the next morning, and moves down to Sally exiting her building and the whole of all coming out of their tents, all dressed in their regular outfits. Then, they all hear Mater, who is heard laughing and cheering.]", "Sally Carrera: Wow!", "Tow Mater: Mornin', Sally! Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!", "Sally Carrera: Yes! Ahmm. Amazing! [Luigi and Guido are also seen, impressed at the new tarmac. Then we see Ramone, who has changed his paint from purple to green. Ramone driving on the new tarmac, lifts his front up]", "Ramone: Yeah! [sighs and moves his front back down]", "Flo: Oh, Ramone, Mama ain't seen you that low in years.", "Ramone: I haven't seen a road like this in years.", "Flo: Well, then let's cruise, baby.", "Ramone: Low and slow.", "Luigi: [speaking Italian] È Bellissima! It's beautiful! Guido, look, it's a like it was paved by angels. Oh!!", "Tow Mater: Oh, I tell ya what. I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.", "Sally Carrera: Doc, look at this! Should a tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?", "Doc Hudson: Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.", "Luigi: Guido, look at Luigi! [Mater lets go, and Luigi slides across the tarmac at the crossroad. Luigi driving back and forth once across the tarmac, Luigi chuckling] This is fantastico!", "Sally Carrera: That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!", "Lizzie: Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.", "Luigi: [groans] That crazy old devil woman. [sighs as he and Guido get shocked at the look of their store] She's right!", "Sally Carrera: [shrieks and sliding along the tarmac and back the other way]", "Luigi: (weeping) Guido!", "Doc Hudson: Huh! That punk actually did a good jab. [noticing Bessie on the other road] Well, now... where the hack is he? [Then the screen shows Lightning McQueen in the desert driving on the same dirt road used for the race track. Doc then comes to Sheriff, who was watching McQueen.] Sheriff! Is he making another run for it?", "Sheriff: No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, asked me if he could come down here. All he's trying to do is make that there turn.", "Lightning McQueen:  NO NO NO NO! Aw, great! Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.", "Doc Hudson: Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's. I'll keep an eye on him.", "Sheriff: Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feeling a quart low. [drives back to Radiator Springs]", "Lightning McQueen: AAH!!!!!", "Doc Hudson: This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, great. What do you want? You hear to gloat? [drives past slowly]", "Doc Hudson: You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.", "Lightning McQueen: [turns around] So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.", "Doc Hudson: I'll put it simple. If you goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.", "Lightning McQueen: Ooh, right, that makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you! Or should I say, No thank you? Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, Thank you! Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!", "Doc Hudson: [groans as he then drives away slowly back to Radiator Springs with his feelings hurt by McQueen.]", "Lightning McQueen: Turn right to go left. Mm... OH! WHOA! OW! Oh, that-- ........... OWWWWWWWWW!!!!!", "Lightning McQueen: Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it. You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!", "Lizzie: You keep talking to yourself, people'll think you're crazy!", "Lightning McQueen: Thanks for the tip.", "Lizzie: What? I wasn't talking to you!", "Sally Carrera: Oh, Guido, è bellissimo!", "Guido: Che cosa?", "Sally Carrera: It looks great! This is great!", "Guido: Ti place, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.", "Tow Mater:  Oh, Lord. Huh?", "Sheriff: Mater! I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.", "Tow Mater: Well, Dad Gum! Wait a minute. What if he tries to run again?", "Sheriff: Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back. But keep an eye on him.", "Tow Mater: Yes, sir! [closes one eye, and keeps the other open] Unh!", "Lightning McQueen: While I'm stuck here paving this stinking road, chick's in california schmoozing Dinoco. My Dinoco. [feels something] WHOA WHOA WHOA! Who's touching me?!", "Luigi: You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix. You make a such a nice new road. You come to my shop. Luigi take a good care of you. Even though you not a Ferrari. [to McQueen] You buy four tires, I give you a full size spare absolutely free!", "Lightning McQueen: Look, I get all my tires for free.", "Luigi: [chuckles and gasps] I like your style, eh? You drive the hard bargain. Okay, Luigi make you a new deal. You buy one tire, I give you three for free!", "Flo: Aw... Would you look at that! Ramone, Ramone.", "Ramone: [chuckles]", "Luigi: Then Luigi make you a new deal.", " Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you. [The screen then shows McQueen, Luigi, Guido.]", "Luigi: No, no, no, no, no. This is it, my last offer. You buy one tire, I give you 7-a snow tire for all free! Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.", "Lightning McQueen: Stop! Let me--!", "Sally Carrera: [noticing a cactus piece on McQueen's hood] Oh, Red! You missed a spot, see it right there? On the hood right there.", "Lightning McQueen: No, no!", "Lightning McQueen: NO! Stop! Stop! That cold! Help! Please stop!", "Sally Carrera: Thanks, Red.", "Lightning McQueen: What was that for?!", "Sally Carrera: Do you wanna stay at the Cozy Cone or what?", "Lightning McQueen: Huh?", "Sally Carrera: And if you do, you gotta be clean. 'Cause even here in hillibilly hell we have standards.", "Lightning McQueen: What, I--? I don't get it.", "Sally Carrera: Nothing I just thought I'd say thank you for doing a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there, but there in your own Cozy Cone. And I'd be in my cone, and it's...", "Lightning McQueen: Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.", "Sally Carrera: I mean if you want to stay at the dirty impound, that's, that's fine. You know, I understand you criminal types.", "Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no. That's okay. Yeah, the Cozy Cone. [looks at the Cozy Cone Motel]", "Sally Carrera: Eu, it's newly refurbished.", "Lightning McQueen: [chuckles] Yeah, it's like a clever little twist the motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars usually try to avoid, now we're gonna stay in them. [chuckles] That's funny.", "Sally Carrera: Figure that all out on your own, did you? [reverses and turns around, drives back to the motel] Cone number one, if you want.", "Lightning McQueen:  Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?", "Sally Carrera: OH! That's just a-- [bumps into a pile of cones, with one on her roof] OH! [McQueen and Sally laughing] Oh, You saw that? Yeah! Just gonna be going. Gonna...Yeah.", "Tow Mater: Ya know, I once knew this girl doreen. Good-lookin' girl! Looked just like a jaguar, only she was a truck! Ya know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her!", "Lightning McQueen: What are you talking about?" ,"Tow Mater: I don't know. Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' ya!", "Lightning McQueen: No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.", "Tow Mater: Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt. You probably couldn't handle it anyway.", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater. You know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything.", "Lightning McQueen: [Whispers] Mater, I'm not doing this.", "Tow Mater: Aw, come on, you'll love it! [Mater chuckles. The screen then shows a field full of sleeping tractors.] Tractor-tippin's fun!", "Lightning McQueen: [Tractors snoring] This is ridiculous.", "Tow Mater: [to McQueen] Alright, listen, when I say go, we go, but don't let Frank catch ya, GO!", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, Wait, Wait! W--Wh--Who's Frank? ", "Tow Mater: Okay, here's what you do, ye just sneak up in front of them, and then honk? And they do the rest. Watch this. ", "Tow Mater: I swear, tractors is so dumb! I tell you what, buddy, ye don't get much better than this.", "Lightning McQueen: Yep, you're living the dream, Mater boy.", " Tow Mater: I don't care who you are, that's funny right there. [to the team, to McQueen] Ah, you turn, bud.", "Lightning McQueen: Mater, I can. I do even have a horn.", "Tow Mater: Big guy", "Lightning McQueen: I'm a big, guy!", "Tow Mater: [clucking]", "Lightning McQueen: Stop, Stop, Okay? Alright, I'll do something and honk so I have a horn.", "Tow Mater: ... That's Frank.", "Lightning McQueen: AHHH!!!!! [Screams]", "Tow Mater: RUN!!! RUN, HE'S GONNA GET YA!", "Sally Carrera: Customers!", "Tow Mater: Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghost light!", "Lightning McQueen: I can't wait, Mater.", "Tow Mater: Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya! [As Mater talks, the screen shows Sally, who notices them, sighs, grins and drives back into the building. Then the screen shows Mater, McQueen and the team again.] Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun!", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, Yeah Yeah.", "Tow Mater: Well, we better get ya back to the impound lot.", "Lightning McQueen: You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.", "Tow Mater: Aw. Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, co-No, No, Are you kidding? Besides, she can't stand me. [McQueen scoffs] And I don't like her, to be honest.", "Tow Mater: Yeah, you probably right: HEY, LOOK, THERE'S MISS SALLY!", "Lightning McQueen: [looking around] Where-Where?!", "Tow Mater: [laughing] [McQueen groans] You're in love with Miss Sally!", "Lightning McQueen: [As our heroes are talking, Sally then turns to see them from inside the building.] No, I'm not.", "Tow Mater: Yes, ya do.", "Lightning McQueen: No way.", "Tow Mater: Way.", "Lightning McQueen: Come on, look...", "Tow Mater: [turns around and drives backwards] You're in love with Miss Sally! You're in love with Miss Sally!", "Lightning McQueen: Okay, that's real mature Mater, real grown up.", "Tow Mater: You love her! You love her, you love her! You love her, You love her, You love her!", "Lightning McQueen: Wait... [Mater laughs and noticing Mater driving backwards]", "Tow Mater: Touch", " Lightning McQueen: driving backwards stuff. You're gonna wreck on something.", "Tow Mater: [stops moving] Shoot, I'm the world's best backwards driver! You just watch this right here, lover boy. [drives backwards with his lights on, drives towards one of the Cozy Cones", "Lightning McQueen: What are you doing?! Watch out, Look out! Mater?! [Mater then drives around the cone.] Mater! [Mater laughs as he drives around a few more cones] Mater! [Sally watches as Mater drives around the building. Finally, Mater drives backwards onto the desert ground, stops, and starts spinning.] Hey, take it easy, Mater!", "Tow Mater: [screams happily. Then Mater stops spinning, and drives backwards into the forest, laughing. Mater grunting and blubbering, and jumps high up into the air in front of the full orange Moon]", "Lightning McQueen: [Laughs] He's nuts.", "Tow Mater: [driving back to McQueen and while still going backwards] No need to watch where I'm goin'! [jumps and turns around as he stops in front of McQueen] Just need to know where I've been. [turns his lights off]", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?", "Tow Mater: Rear view mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.", "Lightning McQueen: [chuckles] Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race. [drives along]", "Tow Mater: What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?", "Lightning McQueen: [stops moving, and turns around] It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup! I've been dreaming about it my whole life! I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it. And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters. No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.", "Tow Mater: What's wrong with rusty old cars?", "Lightning McQueen: Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know? Not like you. I like you.", "Tow Mater: Nah, it's okay, buddy. [to McQueen] Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of 'em helicopters? I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters.", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.", "Tow Mater: You mean it?", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, yeah. Anything you say.", "Tow Mater: I knew it. I knew I made a good choice!", "Lightning McQueen: In what?", "Tow Mater: My best friend.", "Tow Mater: See you tomorrow, buddy! [Mater then turns on his lights, swings his hook, and drives backwards around McQueen and back to his home. Mater singing as he drives backwards] McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree, K-i-s-s somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now then...  Number 1, number 1!  Oh, Number 1! Ha, this is nice.", "Sally Carrera: Hey, Stickers! [McQueen screams and Sally shrieks] I'm sorry!", "Lightning McQueen: [turns around] Whoq! You scared me, you gotta be careful.", "Sally Carrera: I scared myself scaring you scaring me.", "Lightning McQueen: I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.", "Sally Carrera: No, of course not. Not.", "Lightning McQueen: I was more...", "Sally Carrera: Just I overheard you talking to Mater.", "Lightning McQueen: When? Just, just now? What, what did, what did you hear?", "Sally Carrera: Oh, just something about a helicopter ride.", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he?", "Sally Carrera: Did you mean it?", "Lightning McQueen: What?", "Sally Carrera: That you'll get him a ride.", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, who knows? I mean first things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.", "Sally Carrera: Uh-huh. You know Mater trusts you.", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah, okay.", "Sally Carrera: Did you mean that?", "Lightning McQueen: What?", "Sally Carrera: Was it just a Yeah, okay, or Yeah...okay or Yea-yeah, okay?", "Lightning McQueen: Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day.", "Sally Carrera: Yeah, okay. Good night. [turns around and drives back to the building]", "Lightning McQueen: [McQueen grunts as he remembers what asked him to do] Ah..., thank you.", "Sally Carrera: [Sally then stops, and turns around.] What did you just say?", "Lightning McQueen: You know, thanks for letting me stay here. It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great. Newly refurbished, right?", "Sally Carrera: Yeah.", "Lightning McQueen: Good 'night.", "Sally Carrera: Good night. [drives back to her building, Sally giggles. Then McQueen presses a button to close the door on the cone.", "Sarge:  Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!", "Fillmore: Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix.", "Lightning McQueen: No! [gasping] [Then an alarm beeps as a model car pops in and out of a miniature cone alarm clock.] I gotta get outta here! Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? [The screen shows inside Doc Hudson's building as McQueen and come in, notices Sheriff's rear, as Sheriff is on a ramp up in the air] Oh! Oh, my gosh. Oh!", "Doc Hudson: [The screen turns around as it shows that Doc Hudson was sorting something on Sheriff's undercarriage. Doc turns around] Hey, what are you doing?!", "Sheriff: Get a good peak, City Boy?", "Lightning McQueen: [Stutters] I, a.. a.. I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.", "Doc Hudson: [angrily] Wait for him at Flo's, now get outta here.", "Lightning McQueen: I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET OUTTA HERE FOR 3 DAYS! [McQueen and then leave the building.]", "Sheriff: Hope you enjoyed the show! ", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa ho, Doc. Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on. What? He has a Piston Cup?  Oh, my gosh. Three Piston Cup?", "Doc Hudson: Sign says stay out. [McQueen gasps upon hearing Doc's voice]", "Lightning McQueen: [They all reverse and see Doc standing grumpily outside the door.]You, You've three Piston Cups. How could you have--? [Doc drives in]", "Doc Hudson: I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read. [as Doc pushes our heroes outside]", "Lightning McQueen: You're the Hudson Hornet!", "Doc Hudson: Wait over at Flo's, like I told you!!", " Lightning McQueen: Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before! You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! You still to hold the record for most wins in single season! Oh, we gotta talk. You gotta show me your tricks. Please.", " Doc Hudson: I already tried that.", "Lightning McQueen: And you won the championship three times! Look at those trophies!", "Doc Hudson: You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups. [closes the doors. McQueen frowns]", "Fillmore: You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man.", "Sarge: Oh, take a car wash, hippie.", "Flo: Yeah, look at my husband, y'all. WHOO! That's your color!", "Ramone: Yellow, baby. [chuckles]", "Flo: Mm! You smoking hot!", "Sheriff: [noticing McQueen and come towards them] There he is!", "Lightning McQueen: Oh My Gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous race-car?!",  "Folks: [All of the residents stay silent for a few seconds, then all of them except Sheriff laugh.]", "Sheriff: Doc? Our Doc?", "Sarge: Not Doc Hudson.", "Lightning McQueen: No no no no no, it's true! He's a real racing legend. He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!", "Flo: Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour. I mean, have you ever seen him race?", "Lightning McQueen: No, but I wish I could have of... They say he was amazing, he wins three Piston Cups!", "Tow Mater: [spits out on his drink] He did what in his cup?!" ,"Sheriff: I think the heat's starting to get to the boy!" ," Lizzie: Well, I'll say! Look how red he is! [McQueen frowns]", "Ramone: Yeah, I think he needs a new coat of poly, man.", "Tow Mater: Are ya sick, buddy?", "Sheriff: You are looking a little peaked." ,"Ramone: Yeah, he needs a new coat of poly for sure!", " Sheriff: Hey-Hey! What are you doing?!", "Sally Carrera: It's okay, Sheriff. You can trust me, right?", "Sheriff: I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about.", "Sally Carrera: Mm... I trust him. [to McQueen] Come on, let's take a drive.", "Lightning McQueen: A drive?", "Sally Carrera: Yeah, a drive. Don't you big city race cars ever just take a drive?", "Lightning McQueen: Uh, No. No, we don't.", "Sally Carrera: Hey, Stickers! Do you comin' or what?", "Flo: [Sally and the whole of then fly and chuff the other way out of town toward the courthouse. McQueen then turns around and follows them.] Mm-hm! [to Sheriff] And you thought he was gonna run. [Sheriff turns off his emergency lighting.]", "Ramone: Hey, can you believe it, man? He actually thought Doc was a famous race-car! [Laughing] That's so too much!", "Lightning McQueen: [The screen shows McQueen and the whole of catching up with Sally after they go past Radiator Cap Mountain, to Sally] Okay, you got me out here. Where are we going?", "Sally Carrera: I don't know. [Then McQueen revs his engine and moves a bit ahead of Sally, then Sally revs hers and moves a bit ahead. McQueen does the same thing, then Sally races off.]", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa! Yes!", "Lightning McQueen: Wow! What is this place?", "Sally Carrera: Wheel Well. Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.", "Lightning McQueen: [Our heroes then see a few gas pumps, and then look at some old cans and parts with flies flying and crawling.] This place? [The screen shows a closeup of the flies buzzing around and crawling. The car-ified bugs beep their horns. The camera then zooms out.]", "Sally Carrera: [sighs] Yeah, imagine...Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here.", "Lightning McQueen: [to Sally] You know, I don't get you. How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?", "Sally Carrera: Well, it's really pretty simple. I was... [drives into the motel, while our heroes follow her in.] ...an attorney in LA living life in the fast lane, and.", "Lightning McQueen: Ah, you were, were you? Were you rich?", "Sally Carrera: What?", "Lightning McQueen: Just... clues to the puzzle.", "Sally Carrera: Yeah, okay. Well, that was my life. And you know what? It never felt...happy.", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah. I mean...really?", " Sally Carrera: Yeah. So I left California. Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in. Well, they all did. And I never left. [Sally then drives out of the motel as the screen shows from behind one of the windows with a few flies crawling on it, along with a dead one being upside down. Our heroes then follow Sally outside.", " Lightning McQueen: Yeah. You know, I understand. You need a little R & R. Recharge and old batteries. But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?", "Sally Carrera: [Inhales deeply] I fell in love.", "Lightning McQueen: Oh.", "Sally Carrera: Yep.", "Lightning McQueen: Corvette?", "Sally Carrera: No. [drives to the cliff with small logs as barriers, as McQueen and the whole team follow her] I fell in love with this.", "Lightning McQueen: Whoa. [seeing the mountain where the road led up to] Look at that. [sees some traffic driving on the Interstate 40 in the distance] Look, they're driving right by. They don't even know what they're missing!", "Sally Carrera: Well, it didn't usedy.", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, yeah?", "Sally Carrera: Yeah. 40 years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.", " Lightning McQueen: [The screen shows the Interstate again as it does an illusion of the Interstate fading and the hills joined up.]", "Sally Carrera: Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.", "Lightning McQueen: [The screen then goes to a flashback showing an aerial view of some traffic driving along Route 66 as Sally starts talking.]", " Sally Carrera: Well, the road didn't cut through land like that Interstate. It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved. [The screen then shows at ground level as it moves from side to side beside the road with traffic going by.]", "Folk: Mornin'! Nice day, huh?", "Sally Carrera: [narrating] Cars didn't drive on it to make a great time. They drove on it to have a great time.", "Lightning McQueen: Well, what happened?", "Sally Carrera: The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.", " Lightning McQueen: How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!", "Sally Carrera: Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days, we'll find a way to get it back on the map.", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.", "Sally Carrera: You're welcome. [drives back to the Cozy Cone Motel]", "Tow Mater: Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, okay?! [drives away]", "Lightning McQueen: [chuckling] Wha... What?", "Ramone: Oh, man, the paint's still wet! [drives away]", "Luigi: No, no, no, no, get out of the store! [notices another tractor munching on a radial tire] Hey?! DON'T EAT THE RADIAL! Here, take-a the snow tires.", "Sheriff: MATER!", "Tow Mater: I wasn't tractor-tippin'!", "Sheriff: THEN WHERE DID ALL THESE GOL-DURN TRACTORS COME FROM?!", "Fillmore: [McQueen laughs, exclaiming] WHOA, BOY! WHOA!", "Lightning McQueen: Come here, little tractor, come here. Yeah, that's a good tractor. No, no, no, no, come here. ", "Lightning McQueen: What are you doing? You're not supposed to go wandering off all--alone. What are you doing with those old racing tires? [The screen does a closeup of Doc's side to show us one of his racing tires. It then moves to on the road to show him still standing there. Doc sighs heavily] [McQueen whispering] Come on, Doc, drive. ", "Doc Hudson: [sighs heavily] Yeah.", "Lightning McQueen: [McQueen and the whole team come toward Doc.] Wow! [noticing our heroes] You're amazing! [But Doc just angrily drives away. McQueen coughs from the dust] What are you doing? Doc, wait!", "Tow Mater: Giddy-up right in there! Come on, Rusty. WHEE-HE!", "Lightning McQueen: [McQueen and the whole of eventually catch up with Doc as he drives into his garage.] Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!", "Doc Hudson: Wonderful. Now, go away.", "Lightning McQueen: [as he and the whole team drive into the garage] Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!", "Doc Hudson: I'm asking you to leave.", "Lightning McQueen: Come on. I'm a race car, you're a much older race car, but under the hood you and I are the same.", "Doc Hudson: We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out. [drives out of his garage]", "Lightning McQueen: How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?", "Doc Hudson: [pauses] You think I quit? [Doc then presses a button on the garage floor to turn on a light beside our heroes, who then look to see a newspaper's front page on the wall saying Crash! Hudson Hornet out for season", "Lightning McQueen: Right. Your big wreck in '54.", "Doc Hudson: They quit on me, when I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome, you know what they said? You're history, moved right on to the next rookie standing in line, there was a lot left in me, I never got a chance to show 'em, I keep that, to remind me never to go back, I just never expected that that world would find me here.", "Lightning McQueen: Hey, look, Doc, I'm not 'em.", " Doc Hudson: Oh, yeah?", "Lightning McQueen: No, I'm not.", "Doc Hudson: When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod? You name me one time. And I will take it all back. [McQueen then feels ashamed.] Uh-huh? I didn't think so. [to McQueen, who then feels ashamed again] These are good folk around here, who care about one another. I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, like you? You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are? [Doc then looks hurt at McQueen's fact.] Who's caring about only himself?", "Doc Hudson: Just finish that road and get outta here! [drives away]", "Sarge: Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!", "Fillmore: Respect the classics, man.", "Tow Mater: He's done. He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'.", "Doc Hudson: Good riddance. [Doc then drives away as the other residents arrive at the same scene. Ramone has a red paint job.]", "Flo: He's gone?", "Sarge: Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his. [Sally drives away.]", "Sheriff: [sniffs]", "Ramone: Oh, dude, are you crying?", " Sheriff: NO! I'M HAPPY! I DON'T HAVE TO WATCH HIM EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY ANYMORE! I'M GLAD HE'S GONE!", "Red: [blubbers, then sobs and drives away, again knocking down that same pile of tires at that corner of the impound. Just then, McQueen and the whole of show up after just coming back through the portal.]", "Lightning McQueen: What's wrong with Red?", "Tow Mater:Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town, and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about yer whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talking about.  I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.", "Lightning McQueen: [chuckles]", "Sheriff: What are you doing here, son? You're gonna miss your race. [turns on his emergency lighting] Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up the time.", "Lightning McQueen: Thank you, Sheriff. But you know I can't go just yet.", "Sheriff: Well, why not?", "Lightning McQueen: I'm not sure these tires... [Luigi gasps excitedly] ...can get me all the way to California. [Guido: Pit stop?!] Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?", "Luigi: [laughing] I can't-a believe it!", "Luigi: Four new tires! Grazien, Mr. Lightning. [gives a hug] Grazien!", "Flo: [Sally then arrives, feeling glad as she sees McQueen.] Would you look at that!", "Luigi: Our first real customers in years! I am filled with tears of ecstasy, [While Luigi is talking, McQueen winks to and Sally, who is then shown smiling. Doc then appears, starting to feel angry hen he sees McQueen.] for this is the most glorious day of my life!", "Lightning McQueen: [as Luigi presses a button to make the car lift he is on go up] Alright, Luigi, give me the best set of black walls you've got.", "Luigi: [releases the button, making the lift go back down] NO,No,No,No! You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want. [drives to a couple of shelves, with one holding blackwall tires, and another being covered by a curtain] Black wall tires. They blend into the pavement. But-a this: [presses a button to pull the curtain, showing whitewall tires]  White-Wall Tires! They say, Look at me! Here I am! Love me.", "Lightning McQueen: Alright, you're the expert.", "Luigi: [chuckles and Doc snarls and drives away]", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, and don't forget the spare.", "Luigi: Perfetto. Guido!", "Guido: Peet stop!", "Luigi: [chuckling] What did Luigi tell you, Huh?", "Lightning McQueen: Wow, you were right! Better than a Ferrari, huh?", "Luigi: [frowns] Eh, no. Get your kicks on Route 66", "Lightning McQueen: [McQueen then frowns, and then the screen shows him and the whole team with Fillmore at the Taste-Inn, drinking some organic fuel.] Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?", "Fillmore: It's a conspiracy, man!! The oil companies got a grip on the government!! They're feeding us a bunch of lies, man!", "Lightning McQueen: Okay, I'll take a case.", "Well it goes from St Louis, Joplin, Missouri Oklahoma City looks ooh, so pretty You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona Kingsman, Barstaw, San Bernadino", "Tow Mater: Here she comes!", "Lightning McQueen: Okay, places, everybody.

What do you think? Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.", "Sally Carrera: [giggles] I'll say. [purrs as McQueen continues revving his engine] Ka-chow. You're gonna fit right in in California. Oh, my goodness, it looks like you've helped everybody in town.", "Lightning McQueen: Yeah, everybody except one.", "Lightning McQueen: Hey, is it getting dark out?", "Lizzie: Wh...What!? Wha--What'd he say?", "Lightning McQueen: Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?!", "Lizzie: Now, what was I supposed to do after that?", "Sally Carrera: [Gasping] They fixed their neon.", "Flo: Low and slow?", "Ramone: Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckles as they take a cruise along the main road to the Courthouse. Flo laughs and shrieks. McQueen to Sally]", "Lightning McQueen: Just like in its heyday, right?", "Sally Carrera: [exhales] It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you. Lightning McQueen: Shall we cruise?", "Lizzie: [appearing out of nowhere] Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to! [pulls McQueen away]", "Lightning McQueen: No no no!", 
"Sally Carrera: Lizzie!", "Lizzie: [to McQueen as they drive along] I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.", "Tow Mater: [to Mater] Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise?", "Sally Carrera: Of course, Mater.", "Sheriff: [stopping them] A-A-Ah!", "Lizzie: ...and again and I said, no, and he asked me again, and I said, no... [Sally giggles as she notices McQueen stepping sideways while with Lizzie] ...but, oh, he was a persistent little burger for a two-cylinder... [continues driving, while McQueen stops and turns around] ...finally I said, alright, one little drive... [McQueen looks to see the other townsfolk still cruising. Suddenly, Mater grabs him with his tow hook.]", "Lightning McQueen: OH!", "Tow Mater: [laughs, Dah ha ha ha ha ha! tows him to Sally, and lets go]", "Lightning McQueen: Hey!", "Sally Carrera: Thanks, Mater.", "Tow Mater: Good evening, ya two! [McQueen and Sally then look at each other. Lizzie standing next to Stanley's statue]", "Lizzie: Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this. [McQueen and Sally then touch each other's front. Flo noticing something]", "Flo: Is that what I think it is?", "Sally Carrera: Oh, I don't know, Flo. I haven't had a chance to find out. [both her and McQueen close their eyes] But I am going to find out. Hello.", "Flo: Not that. That.", "Sally Carrera: [Everyone then looks into the distance to see lots of headlights approaching. Sally gasping] Customers?", "Flo: Customers, everybody! And a lot of them! You know what to do, just like we rehearsed!", "Tow Mater: [Suddenly, a blue light shines on McQueen. A townsfolk gasp] It's the Ghost-Light!", "Kathy Copter: [shown to be shining the light] We have found McQueen! We have found McQueen!", "Cameramen: [It is then shown that the people who have arrived are actually the press, coming towards McQueen and surrounding him, flashing their cameras.] McQueen, over here, kid!", "Lightning McQueen: Oh, wait......Excuse me.", "Cameramen: Is it true you've been in rehab?! Did you have a nervous breakdown, McQueen?!", "Lightning McQueen: I'm sorry, what?", "Cameramen: McQueen's wearing whitewalls! Are the tires you wearing are turning balding?!", "Sally Carrera: Stickers, McQueen!", "Cameramen: [to Mater] Was Lightning McQueen your prisoner?!", "Tow Mater: Shoot, no, we're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin', but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape.", "Lightning McQueen: Sally, Sally!", "Kori Turbowitz: McQueen, will you still race for the Piston Cup?!", "Sally Carrera: Stickers?!", "Lightning McQueen: Sally!", "Cameramen: Come on, give us some bolt!

I can't believe it! [Sally then watches as she notices the picture on the side of Mack's trailer. Mack chuckles to McQueen] You are a sight for sore headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you...", "Lightning McQueen: Mack, I can't believe you're here!", "Harv: Is that the world's fastest racing machine?", " Lightning McQueen: Is that Harv?", "Mack: Yeah, he's in the back.

Harv!", "Cameramen: Give us the bolt!", "Lightning McQueen: [The trailer door then opens, showing no one in the trailer.] Harv?", "Cameramen: Come on!", "Harv: [on the phone, as it pops out] Kid, I'm over here!", "Lightning McQueen: How you doing, buddy?", "Harv: My star client disappears off the face of the earth! How do you think I'm doing?!", "Lightning McQueen: Harv, I can explain...", "Harv: I'm doing great! You're everywhere, baby, radio, TV, the papers! You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for?! That's just a figure of speech by the way you signed a contract. Where are you?! I can't even find you on my GPS.", "Lightning McQueen: I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. You know Route 66? It's still here!", "Harv: Yeah, that's great, kid. Playtime is over, pal.

Thanks for everything.", "Lightning McQueen: [sighs and laughs] It just a road.", "Sally Carrera: No. It was much more than that. [The screen shows McQueen with tears in his eyes. Mack comes to McQueen]", "Mack: Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's going CRAZY! He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now!", "Lightning McQueen: Mack, just hold it for...", "Sally Carrera: You should go.", "Lightning McQueen: I know, but...", "Sally Carrera: Good luck in California.

You're a big shining star. You're a superstar. You don't belong there, anyway.", "Lightning McQueen: [As Harv is talking, McQueen takes one last look at the town and the whole of before the trailer door starts to close.] Whoa Wait Whoa Whoa Wait Wait!

The crowd gasps at what happened.]","Lynda Weathers: Oh, no.","Chick: Yeah! Whoo-hoo! [goes onto the infield and spins around] I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!", "Flo: What's he up to, Doc?","The King: What are you doing, kid?", "Lightning McQueen: I think The King should finish his last race.

Yeah!","Rust-eze Folks: [The crowd then cheers, before McQueen comes back to the Rust-eze team and who are laughing and cheering.]","Rusty: You make us proud, kid!","Mack: Congrats on the loss, me bucko!","Doc Hudson: You got a lotta of stuff, kid.", "Lightning McQueen: Thanks, Doc.","Tex: Hey, Lightning. How about coming over here and talk to me a minute? Son, that was some real racin' out there. How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?","Lightning McQueen: [feeling surprised, looks towards the Dinoco team, which Rotor Turbosky winks] But I didn't win.","Tex: Lightning, there's a whole lot more to racing than just winning.","Dusty: He was so rusty, when he drove down the street buzzards used to circle the car!","Folks: [laughs]","Lightning McQueen: [looking towards them] Thank, you, Mr. Tex, but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them.","Tex: Well, I sure can respect that. Still, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.","Lightning McQueen: I sure appreciate that, thank you... Actually, there's 1 thing...","Tow Mater: [riding in Rotor Turbosky, Dinoco is helicopter, over Radiator Springs] WHOO-HOO! [laughs] Hey, look at me! I'm flying, by golly! Whoo-hoo! [as most of the Radiator Springs residents watch from the ground] I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park!

Hi, Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How about setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each?","Luigi: [Gasps] Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store. A REAL FERRARI! Punch me, Guido, punch me in the face. This is the most glorious day of my life. [Faints]","Michael Schumacher: Whoa, [speaks Italian to Guido] spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici.","Sally Carrera: Just passing through?","Lightning McQueen: Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile, I hear this place is back on the map.","Sally Carrera: It is?","Lightning McQueen: Yeah, there's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racing headquarters here.","Sally Carrera: Really? Well, there goes the town.","Lightning McQueen: You know, I really missed you, Sally.","Sally Carrera: Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, blah, blah, blah, blah.","Lightning McQueen: [chuckles as they move slowly toward each other, Mater appearing onboard Rotor]","Tow Mater: McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree, K-i-s-s... auuu... i-n-t!","Lightning McQueen: Great timing, Mater!","Tow Mater: [as Rotor flies away] Hepnon, hiphep, hilililly!

Why don't we just take a drive?","Sally Carrera: Hmm, nah. [quickly drives away]","Lightning McQueen: Yeah, KaChow. [follows Sally and as they race each other, while John Mayer's version of Route 66 plays, with Mater yelling while riding in Rotor.]","Tow Mater: YEEEEEEHHOOOOOOOOO!","Tow Mater: All right, everybody please keep together now. We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum. [shows them the part that mentions Doc having 27 wins in 1952]","Junior: Whoa. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season.","The King: He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.","Lynda Weathers: [to Mater] Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today?","Tow Mater: Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or something.","Lightning McQueen: Whoo! Whoo!","Doc Hudson: Yeah! Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.","Lightning McQueen: Not today, old man. I know all your tricks. [Doc growls and turns towards the cliff. McQueen stop and look down the edge, thinking Doc fell in a cactus patch.] Doc! Doc!","Doc Hudson: [But Doc did not wind up in a cactus patch because he is seen jumping back to the ground level McQueen are on.] Whoo-ah! Not all my tricks, rookie!","Sarge: Attention!

It’s actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can’t really tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.","SHELDON: I’m H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]","TAD: I’m obnoxious.","MR. RAY: [singing] Oh... Let’s name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let’s name the zones of the open sea.","CHILDREN: Mr. Ray!","SHELDON: Come on, Nemo.","MARLIN: You better stay with me.","MR. RAY: Mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see. Huh. I wonder where my class has gone?","KIDS: We’re under here!","MR. RAY: There you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.","NEMO: Dad, you can go now.","MR. RAY: Well, hello. Who is this?","NEMO: I’m Nemo.","MR. RAY: Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.","NEMO: OK.","MR. RAY: You live in what kind of home?","NEMO: An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone.","MR. RAY: OK, OK, don’t hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!","MARLIN: Just so you know, he’s got a little fin. I find if he’s having trouble swimming, let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes.","NEMO: Dad, it’s time for you to go now.","MR. RAY: Don’t worry. We’re gonna stay together as a group. OK, class, optical orbits up front. And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves, that means you, Jimmy.","JIMMY: Oh, man!","MARLIN: Bye, Nemo!","NEMO: Bye, Dad!","MARLIN: Bye, son! Be safe.","BOB: Hey, you’re doing pretty well for a first timer.","MARLIN: Well, you can’t hold onto them forever, can you?","BILL: I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the Drop Off.","MARLIN: They just gotta grow up... The Drop Off?! They’re going to the Drop Off! What are you, insane? Why don’t we fry them up now and serve them with chips!","BOB: Hey, Marty. Calm down.","MARLIN: Don’t tell me to be calm, pony boy!","BOB: ‘Pony boy’?","BILL: You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.","TED: Pity...","Mr. Ray: [singing] Oh, let’s name the species, the species, the species. Let’s name the species that live in the sea. There’s porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Just the girls this time. Seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it’s food with the rays of the sun…","Mr. Ray: OK, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps] Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck. There are as many protein pairs contained in this…","Tad: Come on, let’s go.","Mr. Ray: Come on, sing with me! [singing] There’s porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three!","Nemo: Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.","Tad: Cool. Saved your life!","Pearl: You guys made me ink.","Nemo: What’s that?","Tad: I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a butt.","Pearl: Wow. That’s a pretty big butt.","Sheldon: Oh, look at me. I’m gonna go touch the butt. [laughter] Oh, yeah? Let’s see you get closer.","Pearl: OK. Beat that.","Tad: Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?","Nemo: Oh, um... my dad says it’s not safe.","Marlin: Nemo! No!","Nemo: Dad?","Marlin: You were about to swim into open water!","Nemo: No, I wasn’t go out but dad!","Marlin: It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn’t showed up, I don’t know...","Pearl: Sir, he wasn’t gonna go!","Tad: Yeah, he was too afraid!","Nemo: No, I wasn’t!","Marlin: This does not concern you, kids. And you’re lucky I don’t tell your parents you were out there. You know you can’t swim well.","Nemo: I can swim fine, dad, OK?","Marlin: No, it’s not OK. You shouldn’t be anywhere near here. OK, I was right. You know what! You’ll start school in a year or two. [starts to take Nemo away]","Nemo: [jerks out of his grasp] No, Dad! Just because you’re scared of the ocean...","Marlin: Clearly, you’re not ready. And you’re not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things but you just can’t, Nemo!","Nemo: I hate you...","Mr. Ray: [singing] There’s. Nothing to see. Gather, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem?","Marlin: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt things. He isn’t a good swimmer and I just think it’s a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.","Mr. Ray: Well, I can assure you, he’s quite safe with me.","Marlin: Look, I’m sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you’re not looking. I’m not saying you’re not looking...","Kathy: Oh, my gosh! Nemo’s swimming out to sea!","Marlin: Nemo! What do you think you’re doing?","Marlin: You’re gonna get stuck out there and I’ll have to get you before another fish does! Get back here!","Marlin: I said get back here, now! Stop!","Marlin: You take one more move, mister...","Marlin: D-Don’t you dare! If you put one fin on that boat-Are you listening to me? Don’t. Touch. The boa...","Marlin: Nemo!","Tad: (whispers) He touched the butt.","Marlin: You just paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That’s right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...","Marlin: Big...","Pearl: Aah!","Nemo: Aagghh! Daddy! Help me!","Marlin: I’m coming, Nemo! (tries to save Nemo but another diver appears)","Mr. Ray: Get under me, kids!","Nemo: Oh, no, no! Dad! Daddy!","Marlin: Nemo! (a diver flashes him.) No! Nemo!","Nemo: (whimpering)","DIVER MAN: Whoa! Hold on!","Marlin: (panting) Oh, no. No, no. It’s gone, it’s gone. No, no, it can’t be gone. No, no! Nemo! No, please, no! No, no! Has anybody seen a boat! Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!","Dory: Look out!","Dory: Sorry! I didn’t see you. Sir, are you OK? There, there. It’s all right.","Marlin: He’s gone.","Dory: It’ll be OK.","Marlin: No, no. They took him away! I have to find the boat!","Dory: A boat? Hey, I’ve seen a boat!","Marlin: You have?","Dory: It passed by not too long ago.","Marlin: A white one?","Dory: Hi. I’m Dory.","Marlin: Where!? Which way!?","Dory: It went, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!","Marlin: Thank you! Thank you, so much!","Dory: No problem.","Marlin: Hey! Wait!","Dory: Will you quit it?","Marlin: What?","Dory: I’m trying to swim here. What, ocean ain’t big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Do you? You want a piece of me? Yeah, I’m scared now. What!","Marlin: Wait a minute...","Dory: Stop following me, OK?","Marlin: What are talking about? You’re showing me which way the boat went!","Dory: A boat? Hey, I’ve seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this way. Follow me!","Marlin: Wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going!","Dory: I did? Oh, no.","Marlin: If this is some kind of practical joke, it’s not funny! And I know funny... I’m a clownfish!","Dory: No, it’s not. I know it’s not. I’m so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.","Marlin: Short-term memory loss. I don’t believe this!","Dory: No, it’s true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. Or at least I think it does. Where are they? Can I help you?","Marlin: Something’s wrong with you, really. You’re wasting my time. I have to find my son.","Bruce: Hello.","Dory: Well, hi!","Bruce: Name’s Bruce. It’s all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? [laughing] So, what’s a couple of bites like you doing out so late?","Marlin: Nothing. We’re not doing anything. We’re not even out.","Bruce: Great! Then how’d you morsels like to come to a little get-together I’m having?","Dory: You mean like a party?","Bruce: Yeah, right a party! What do you say?","Dory: I love parties! That like sounds fun!","Marlin: Parties are fun, and it’s tempting but can't because...","Bruce: Come on, I insist.","Marlin: OK, that’s all that matters.","Dory: Hey, look. Balloons! It is a party!","Bruce: [chuckling] Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn’t want one of them to pop.","Bruce: Anchor! Chum!","Anchor: There you are, Bruce, finally!","Bruce: We got company.","Anchor: It’s about time, mate.","Chum: We’ve already gone through all the snacks and I’m still starving!","Anchor: We almost had a feeding frenzy.","Chum: Come on, let’s get this over with.","Bruce: Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..","All: I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food.","Anchor: Except stinking dolphins.","Chum: Dolphins. Yeah. They think they’re so cute. Look at me. I’m a flipping little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain’t I something?","Bruce: Right, then. Today’s meeting is step five. Bring a Fish Friend. Now, do you all have your friends?","Anchor: Got mine.","Dory: Hey there!","Bruce: How about you, Chum?","Chum: Well, I seem to have misplaced my friend.","Bruce: That’s all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself to one of my friends.","Chum: Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?","Bruce: I’ll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.","Both: Hello, Bruce.","Bruce: It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.","Chum: You’re an inspiration to all of us!","Anchor: Amen.","Bruce: Right, then. Who’s next?","Dory: Pick me! Pick me!","Bruce: Yes, the little Sheila down the front.","Dory: Whoo!","Bruce: Come on up here.","Dory: Hi. I’m Dory.","Sharks: Hello, Dory.","Dory: And... Well, I don’t think I’ve ever eaten a fish.","Chum: Hey, that’s incredible!","Bruce: Good on ‘ya, mate!","Dory: I’m glad I got that off my chest.","Bruce: All right, anyone else? Hello, how ‘bout you, mate? What’s your problem?","Marlin: Me? I don’t have a problem.","Bruce: OK!","Sharks: Denial.","Bruce: Just start with your name.","Marlin: OK. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I’m a clownfish.","Chum: A clownfish? Really?","Bruce: Go on! Tell us a joke!","Chum: I love jokes!","Marlin: Well, I actually I do know one that’s pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don’t talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber…","Nemo: Daddy!","Marlin: Nemo!","Chum: Nemo! [laughs] I don’t get it.","Bruce: For a clownfish, he’s not that funny.","Marlin: No, no, no, no, he’s my son. He was taken by these divers.","Dory: Oh, my. You poor fish.","Chum: Humans! Think they own everything!","Anchor: Probably American!","Bruce: [tearfully] Now there is a father looking for his little boy.","Marlin: Ugh! What do these markings mean?","Bruce: (sobs) I never knew my father!","Chum: Come here.","Anchor: Group hug.","Chum: We’re all mates here, mate.","Marlin: I can’t read human!","Dory: Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look, sharks! Guys!","Marlin: No, no, no, Dory! Cut it out!","Dory: That’s mine! Give it to me! Ow!","Marlin: I’m sorry. Are you OK? I'm so sorry.","Dory: You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?","Bruce: Dory, are you OK... [sniffs] Oh! That’s good.","Both: Intervention!","Bruce: Just a bite!","Anchor: You hold it together, mate!","Chum: Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!","Bruce: Food!","Marlin: Dory, look out!","Bruce: I’m having fish tonight!","Chum: Remember the steps, mate!","Bruce: Just one bite! G’day!","Marlin: There’s no way out! There’s got to be a way to escape!","Dory: Who is it?","Marlin: Dory, help me find a way out!","Dory: Sorry, you’ll have to come back later. We’re trying to escape!","Marlin: OK. There’s gotta be a way out!","Dory: Look, here’s something! Es-cap-e. I wonder what that means. It’s funny, it’s spelled just like the word escape.","Marlin: Let’s go!","Bruce: Here’s Brucey!","Marlin: Wait a minute. You can read?","Dory: I can read? That’s right! I can read!","Marlin: Well, then here! Read this now!","Anchor: He really doesn’t mean it, you know! He never even knew his father!","Chum: Don’t fall off the wagon!","Marlin: Oh, no. It’s blocked!","Anchor: No, Bruce! Focus!","Chum: Sorry about Bruce, mate!","Anchor: He’s really a nice guy!","Marlin: I need to get that mask!","Dory: You want that mask? OK.","Marlin: No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! Grab it!","Anchor: Oh, no.","Chum: Bruce?","Bruce: What? (gasps) Swim away! Swim away!","Dory: Oh. Is the party over?","Pelican 2: Nice.","NEMO: Dad??? Daddy?","Dr. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Barbara, prep for his anterior crown, would ya please, and, uh, I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.","BARBARA: Okay.","DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Hello, little fella!","NEMO: Ah!","DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: [to patient] Beauty, isn't he?

What did he use to open?","PEACH: Gator-Glidden drill.","NIGEL: He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn’t get surplus sealer at the portal terminus. Hello. Who’s this?","DEB: New guy.","GURGLE: The dentist took him off the reef.","NIGEL: An outie. From my neck of the woods? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you.

Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!","MARLIN: Thank you.","DORY: Oh, dear. Hey, come back! What’s the matter?","MARLIN: What’s the matter? While they’re doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from home, with a fish that can’t even remember her own name.","DORY: Boy, bet that’s frustrating.","MARLIN: Meanwhile my son is out there.","DORY: You’re son Chico? Right. Got it.","MARLIN: Nemo! But it doesn’t matter, ‘cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.","DORY: Well, I’m helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.","MOONFISH: What, is he bothering you again?","DORY: No, he’s a good guy. Go easy on him, he’s lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?","MOONFISH: Sydney? Sure. Why, Ted here’s got relatives in Sydney. Don’t you, Ted?","TED: Sure do.","DORY: They know Sydney! You wouldn’t know how to get there, would you?","MOONFISH: What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that’s the East Australian Current. Big current, can’t miss it, it’s in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I don’t know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby’s gonna put you right past Sydney.","ALL: Ta-da!","MARLIN: Great! That’s great! Dory, you did it!","DORY: Oh, please. I’m just your little helper. Helping along, that’s me.","MARLIN: Well, listen fellas, thank you.","MOONFISH: Don’t mention it. And, loosen up. OK, buddy?","DORY: You guys. You really nailed him. Bye.","MOONFISH: Ma’am, one more thing.","DORY: Yes.","MOONFISH: When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.","DORY :Trench, through it, not over it. I’ll remember. Hey, wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something. Whoa. Nice trench. Hello! OK, let’s go.","MARLIN: Bad trench. Come on, we’re gonna swim over this thing.","DORY: Partner. Little red flag going up. Something telling me we should swim through it, not over it.","MARLIN: Are you even looking at this thing? It’s got death written all over it.","DORY: I’m sorry, but I really, think we should swim through.","MARLIN: And I’m really done talking about this. Over we go.","DORY: Come on, trust me on this.","MARLIN: Trust you?","DORY: Yes, trust. It’s what friends do.","MARLIN: Look! Something shiny!","DORY: Where?","MARLIN: It just swam over the trench. Come on, we’ll follow it.","DORY: OK. Boy, sure is clear up here.","MARLIN: Exactly. And look at that, there’s the current. We should be there in no time.","DORY: Hey, little guy.","MARLIN: You wanted to go through the trench.","DORY: I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here, little Squishy.  Ow.","MARLIN: Dory! That’s a jellyfish!","DORY: Bad Squishy!","MARLIN: Shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.","DORY: Don’t touch it!","MARLIN: I’m not gonna touch it. I just want a look.","DORY: How come it didn't sting you?","MARLIN: It did. It’s just that, hold still. I live in this anemone and I’m used to these kind of stings. Come here. It doesn’t look bad, you’re gonna be fine. But now we know, don’t we? That we don’t want a touch these again. Let’s be thankful this time it was just a little one. Don’t move! This is bad, Dory.","DORY: Watch this! Boing! Boing!","MARLIN: Dory!","DORY: You can’t catch me!","MARLIN: Dory! Don’t bounce on the tops! They will not sting you! The tops don’t sting you, that’s it!","DORY: Two in a row, beat that.","MARLIN: Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.","DORY: A game?","MARLIN: A game. Yes.","DORY: I love games! Pick me!","MARLIN: All right, here’s the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.","DORY: OK!","MARLIN: Rules! You can’t touch the tentacles, only the tops.","DORY: Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!","MARLIN: Wait! Wait! Not something about them, it’s all about them! Wait! Dory!","DORY: Gotta go faster if you want a win!","MARLIN: Dory!","DORY Boing! Boing!","MARLIN: Wait a minute Dory!","DORY: Whee!","MARLIN: So, we’re cheating death now. That’s what we’re doing. We’re having fun at the same time. I can do this, just be careful.","DORY: Careful I don’t make you cry when I win!","MARLIN: I don’t think so!","DORY: Give it up, old man. You can’t fight evolution, I was built for speed.","MARLIN: The question is, Dory, are you hungry?","DORY: Hungry?","MARLIN: Yeah. Cause you’re about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! We did it! We’re gonna... Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory!","DORY: Am I disqualified?","MARLIN: No, you’re doing fine! You’re, you’re actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live?","DORY: P..Sherman..Wallaby Way…Sydney…","MARLIN: That’s it! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake!","DORY: P. Sherman..","MARLIN: Awake…","DORY: ..42 Wallaby Way…Sydney.","MARLIN: Awake…wake up…Nemo…","Gill: You miss your Dad, don’t you, Sharkbait?","Nemo: Yeah.","Gill: Well, you’re lucky to have someone out there who’s looking for you.","Nemo: He’s not looking for me. He’s scared of the ocean.","GILL: Peach, any movement?","PEACH: He’s had at least four cups of coffee, it’s gotta be soon.","GILL: Keep on him. My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin’ for the toilet.","NEMO: Toilet?","GILL: All drains lead to the ocean, kid.","NEMO: Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?","GILL: I’ve lost count. Fish aren’t meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to ‘ya.","BUBBLES: Bubbles!","PEACH: Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader’s Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.","GILL: That’s your cue, Sharkbait.","BLOAT: You can do it, kid.","GILL: You gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and I’ll talk you through the rest.","NEMO: OK.","GILL: Go on, it’ll be a piece of kelp.","GILL: Nicely done! Can you hear me?","NEMO: Yeah.","GILL: Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?","NEMO: Uh-huh.","GILL: OK, inside it you’ll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Sharkbait.","NEMO: I can’t do it!","PEACH: Gill, this isn’t a good idea.","GILL: He’ll be fine. Try again.","NEMO: OK!","GILL: That’s it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.","NEMO: I got it! I got it!","BLOAT: He did it!","GILL: That’s great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.","NEMO: Oh, no! Gill!","GILL: Sharkbait!","BLOAT: Oh,my gosh!","GILL: Get him out of there!","BUBBLES: Help him!","GURGLE: What do we do!? What do we do!?","PEACH: Oh, no!","GILL: Stay calm, kid! Just don’t panic!","NEMO: Help me!","GILL: Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!","NEMO: No! No!","GILL: Feed me more!","GURGLE: That’s it!","GILL: Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!","NEMO:  I got it!","GILL: Pull!","PEACH: Gill, don’t make him go back in there.","GILL: No. We’re done.","CRUSH: Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. He lives! Hey, dude!MARLIN: What happened?","CRUSH: Oh, saw the whole thing, dude. First you were like, ‘whoa’! And then we were all like, ‘whoa’! And then you were like, ‘whoa’.","MARLIN: What are you talking about?","CRUSH: You, mini-man. Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome.","MARLIN: Oh, my stomach.","CRUSH: Oh, man. No hurling on the shell, dude, just waxed it.","MARLIN: So, Mr. Turtle…","CRUSH: Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. Name’s Crush.","MARLIN: Crush? Really? OK, Crush, listen I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC?","CRUSH: [chuckles] Dude, you’re riding it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude!","MARLIN: Grab what. [screaming]","CRUSH: Righteous! Righteous! Yeah!","MARLIN: Stop!","CRUSH: So, what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?","MARLIN: Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. Dory! Is she all right!?","CRUSH: Little Blue. She is sub-level, dude.","MARLIN: Dory, Dory! Dory! Oh, Dory. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.","DORY: 29, 30! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! ","SQUIRT; Whoa!","MARLIN: Oh, my goodness!","CRUSH: Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.","SQUIRT: Whoa! That was so cool! Hey Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you sae what I did?","CRUSH: You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin, noggin.","BOTH: Dude","CRUSH: Intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.","SQUIRT: Jellies? Sweet.","CRUSH: Totally.","MARLIN: Well, apparently, I must’ve done something you all likes dude.","SQUIRT: You rock, dude.","MARLIN: Ow.","CRUSH: Curl away, my son. It’s awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave ‘em on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big ‘ol blue.","MARLIN All by themselves?","CRUSH: Yeah.","MARLIN: But, dude . How do you know when they’re ready?","CRUSH: Well, you never really know. But when they’ll know, you’ll know, you know?","DORY: Hey! Look, everybody!","SQUIRT: I know that dude. It’s the Jellyman.","DORY: Well, go on, jump on him.","TURTLE KIDS: Turtle pile!","MARLIN: Wait, kids.","TURTLE KID 1: Are you funny?","TURTLE KID 2: Where’s your shell?","MARLIN: Hold on, I need to breath...","TURTLE KID 3: Are you running away?","TURTLE KID 4: Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?","TURTLE KID 5: Did they sting you?","MARLIN: One at a time!","TURTLE KID 6: Mr. Fish, did you die?","DORY: Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.","SQUIRT: So where are you going?","MARLIN: Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.","DORY: No way.","SQUIRT: What happened?","MARLIN: No, kids. I don’t want a talk about it.","KIDS: Come on. Please?","SQUIRT: Please?","MARLIN: Well, OK. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.","DORY: Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.","MARLIN: And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. Maybe he wouldn’t have done it if I hadn’t been so tough on him, I don’t know. "," MARLIN: Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam out in the ocean to follow them…","TURTLE KID: They couldn’t stop them. And then Nemo’s dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..","SMALL FISH: ...three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowing them up!","BIG FISH: Golly, that’s amazing!","SMALL FISH: And then dives thousands of...","LOBSTER: ...feet straight down into the dark. It’s like wicked dark down there, you can‘t see a thing. How’s it going, Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..","SWORDFISH: ...is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way…","DOLPHIN: So, these two little fish have been... Searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian Current.","FEMALE BIRD: Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..","MALE BIRD 1: ...Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy’s gonna stop at..","MALE BIRD 2: ...nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.","MALE BIRD 3: That’s one dedicated father if you ask me.","SEAGULLS: Mine! Mine! Mine!","NIGEL: Would you just shut up! You’re rats with wings!","PELICAN 2: ..bloke’s been looking for his boy Nemo. He was taken off the reef by divers and this..","NIGEL: There, take it! You happy!","GULLS: Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!","NIGEL: Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?","GULLS Mine! Mine! Mine!","GULL: Mine!","PELICAN: Last I heard, he’s heading towards the harbor.","NIGEL: Brilliant!","DEB: Is he doing OK?","GURGLE: I don’t know, but whatever you do, don’t mention D-A-R..","NEMO: It’s OK, I know who you’re talking about. Gill? Gill?","GILL: Hey, Sharkbait.","NEMO: I’m sorry I couldn’t stop the...","GILL: No, I’m the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean. I was willing to put you in harm’s way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I’m sorry I couldn’t get you back to your father, kid.","NIGEL: All right! Hey, hey!","Dr. Phillip Sherman: What the!?","Dr. Phillip Sherman: Well, that’s one way to pull a tooth. [laughs] Darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, prime minister?","NIGEL: Psst!","PEACH: Nigel. You just missed an extraction.","NIGEL: Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet.. What I’m talking about!? Nemo! Where’s Nemo? I gotta speak with him.","NEMO: What? What is it?","NIGEL: Your dad’s been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.","NEMO: My father? Really?","GILL: Really?","NIGEL: Oh, yeah. He’s travelled hundreds of miles. He’s been battling sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of...","NEMO: Sharks? That can’t be him.","NIGEL: Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout...","NEMO: Marlin?","NIGEL: That’s it! The little clownfish from the reef.","NEMO: It’s my dad! He took on a shark!","NIGEL: I heard he took on three.","ALL: Three!?","GILL: Three sharks?","BLOAT: That’s got it be 4,800 teeth!","NIGEL: You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac.","NEMO: Really?","NIGEL: He’s swimming and he’s swimming and he’s giving it all he’s got and then three gigantic sharks capture him and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward?"," NIGEL: He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he’s riding with a bunch of sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he’s headed this way right now, to Sydney!","BLOAT: Wow!","DEB: Oh, what a good daddy!","GILL: He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.","GURGLE: He’s swimming to the filter!","BLOAT Not again!","GILL: Sharkbait!","DEB: No!","GURGLE: You’ve got your whole life ahead of you!","BLOAT: Oh, no!","GILL: We’ll help you, kid!","BLOAT: Gotta get him out!","DEB: Give me that thing! Get him out of there!","GURGLE: Come on, kid! Grab the end!","DEB: Sharkbait!","BLOAT: Sharkbait! Are you OK!","GURGLE: No!","GILL: Can you hear me, Sharkbait! Nemo Can you hear me!","NEMO: Yeah, I can hear you.","GILL: Sharkbait, you did it!","GURGLE: Sharkbait, you’re, covered with germs!","GILL: That took guts, kid. All right, gang. We have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank’ll get plenty dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques!","JACQUES Oui!","GILL: No cleaning.","JACQUES I shall resist.","GILL: Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We’re gonna make this tank so filthy, the dentist’ll have to clean it.","GILL: Good work.","CRUSH: All right, we’re here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit’s coming up, man!","MARLIN: Where!? I don’t see it!","DORY: Right there! I see it! I see it!","MARLIN: You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?","CRUSH: That’s it, dude!","MARLIN: Of course it is.","CRUSH: OK, first: find your exit buddy! Do you have your exit buddy?","DORY: Yes!","CRUSH: OK, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!","SQUIRT: Good afternoon, we’re gonna have a great jump today! OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall! There’s a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and punch it!","MARLIN: It’s like he’s trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you’re really cute! But I don’t know what you’re saying! Say the first thing again!","CRUSH: OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!","DORY: Whoo!","MARLIN: That was fun! I actually enjoyed that!","DORY: Hey, look! Turtles!","CRUSH: Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails ‘round and swim straight on through to Sydney! No worries, man!","MARLIN: No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!","KIDS: Bye! Bye, Jellyman!","CRUSH: You tell your little dude I said ‘hi’, OK?","SQUIRT: See you later, dudes!","DORY: Bye, everyone!","MARLIN: Nemo, would’ve loved this. Crush, I forgot! How old are you?","CRUSH: 150, dude! And still young! Rock on!","MARLIN: 150. 150, I gotta remember that.","DORY: Whoa. We going in there?","MARLIN: Yep.","DORY: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?","MARLIN: Yep. We’re gonna just swim straight.","DORY: Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. ","MARLIN: Dory? Boy, this is taking a while.","DORY: How about we play a game?","MARLIN: OK.","DORY: OK I’m thinking of something, orange. And it’s small...","MARLIN: It’s me.","DORY: Right. OK, orange, and small...","MARLIN: It’s me.","DORY: All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants. Orange and small, and white stripes...","MARLIN: Me. And the next one’s just a guess: me.","DORY: OK, that’s just scary.","MARLIN: Wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we’ve passed it before and that means we’re going in circles and that means we’re not going straight!","MARLIN We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let’s figure it out up there. Let’s go! Follow me! What?","DORY: Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. [both inhaling and exhaling] Now, let’s ask somebody for directions.","MARLIN: Fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There’s nobody here!","DORY: Well, there has to be someone. It’s the ocean, silly, we’re not the only two in here. Let’s see…OK, no one there. Nope. Nada. There’s somebody. Hey! Excuse me.","MARLIN: Dory! OK, now it’s my turn. I’m thinking of something dark and mysterious. It’s a fish we don’t know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones!","DORY: What is it with men and asking for directions?","MARLIN: Look, I don’t wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let’s play the ‘Let’s Not Die’ card.","DORY: You want a get outta here, don’t you?","MARLIN: Of course, I do. But, Dory you don't gracefully understand. [sighs] All right.","DORY: Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Come on, trust me on this. Excuse me! Little fella? Hello. Don’t be rude, say ‘hi’.","MARLIN: Hello.","DORY: His son Bingo..","MARLIN: Nemo.","DORY: .. was taken to,","MARLIN: Sydney.","DORY: Sydney. Yes. And it’s really, remember that we get there as fast as we can. So can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on.","MARLIN: Dory, I’m a little fella. I don’t think that’s a little fella.","DORY: Oh, a big fella. Big... A whale... okay, Maybe he only speaks whale. MwOOooo! WwwwEEEE... nEEeeeedd tOOooo FINNND hiIIiiss SONNNNN...","MARLIN: Dory?

It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!","DORY: MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!","MARLIN: It’s just as well, he might be hungry.","DORY: Don’t worry. Whales don’t eat clownfish, they eat krill.","KRILL: Swim away!","DORY: Look. Krill.","MARLIN: Move, Dory! Move!","Gill: Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it’s all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.","Gill: Jacques, I said no cleaning!","JACQUES: I am ashamed.","PEACH: Look. Scum angel.","BUBBLES: Bubbles! I love the bubbles! ","DEB: Flo!

We’re gonna be clean!","GILL: Are you ready to see your dad kid?","NEMO Uh-huh.","GILL: Of course you are. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s out there in the harbor waiting for you right now.","NEMO: Yeah.","DORY: Whoo! Here comes a big one! Come on, you gotta try this!","MARLIN: Would you. Just. stop it!?","DORY: Why? What’s wrong?","MARLIN: We’re in a whale! Don’t you get it!?","DORY: A whale?","MARLIN: A WHALE! ‘Cause you had to ask for help! And now we’re stuck here!","DORY: A whale. You know I speak whale.","MARLIN No, you’re insane! You can’t speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old. Sea. Turtles are!","DORY: Hey. You OK? There, there. It’s all right. It’ll be OK.","MARLIN: No, it won’t.","DORY: Sure it will, you’ll see.","MARLIN: No. I promised him I’d never let anything happen to him.","DORY: Huh. That’s a funny thing to promise.","MARLIN: What?","DORY Well, you can’t never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him... Not much fun for little Harpo.","MARLIN: What’s going on?","DORY: Don’t know. I’ll ask him.","Marlin: Dory... Dory?","Dory: What's going on?","DORY: I think he says we’ve stopped.","MARLIN: Of course, we’ve stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you’re gonna make things worse. What is that noise?","MARLIN: Oh, no. Look what you did. The water’s going down! It’s going down!","DORY: Really? You sure about that?","MARLIN: Look, it’s already half-empty!","DORY: Hmm. I’d say it’s half full.","MARLIN: Stop that! It’s half-empty!","DORY: OK, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float.","MARLIN: Of course he wants us to go there! That’s. Eating us! How do I taste, Moby? Huh? Do I taste good!? You tell him I’m not interested in being lunch!","DORY: OK. He...","MARLIN: STOP TALKING TO HIM!","Marlin: What is going on!?","DORY: I’ll check! What..","MARLIN: No! No more whale! You can’t speak whale!","DORY: Yes, I can!","MARLIN: No, you can’t! You think you could do these things but you can’t, Nemo!","DORY: OK.","MARLIN: Dory!","DORY: He says it’s time to let go!

Your tank environment every five minutes?!","GURGLE: Scan? What does that mean?","AQUASCUM: Temperature, 82 degrees. P-H balance normal.","ALL: Ooh.","PEACH: Nice.","GURGLE: Curse you, Aquascum!","BLOAT: That’s it for the escape plan.
